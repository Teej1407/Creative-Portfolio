I wanted to make a project where you had the first letter of my name fall off the screen 
i likes the style of the 'T' and how i incorporated 3 circles and a rectangle that gave it a uniqe look

i gained my insporation from a task we did in the workshop

i sometimes struggled remembering what the diffrent number values meant but using some codecomments really helped and allowed me to work quicker
