i wanted to make a globe that displayd some text about polution and therefor came up with the idea of spelling 'save the world' letter by letter following the mouse position

i couldnt figure out how to draw un-realistic shape with no sharp corners for the countrys so now it looks more like an ocean plannet 

im happy with how the sequence actually works and im also happy that you cant see the text leak out of the circlem (planet)
